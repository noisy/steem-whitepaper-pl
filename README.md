# Abstract
Steem is a blockchain database that supports community building and social interaction with cryptocurrency rewards.
Steem combines concepts from social media with lessons learned from building cryptocurrencies and their communities.
An important key to inspiring participation in any community, currency or free market economy is a fair accounting system that consistently reflects each person's contribution.
Steem is the first cryptocurrency that attempts to accurately and transparently reward an unbounded number of
individuals who make subjective contributions to its community.
